# Snowii
An app that provides snow conditions at various resorts that are found on https://www.onthesnow.com/. Great for last minute planning for a ski trip.

## Iteration 3
Completed user stories:
- User collects snow conditions data from the internet
- User receives a table of data about snow conditions
- User gets data of snow conditions over multiple days
- User inputs desired location to get snow conditions
- User gets warning for for avalanches

Everything works

Instructions:
1. Go onto command prompt
2. Enter "bash"
3. Switch to "development" branch
4. Enter "./run.sh" 
    - Add two more arguments: Location of Resort(State) and Resort Name (If the state or resort has multiple words, replace space with "-")
    - Otherwise, the console will print out a default set of resorts
